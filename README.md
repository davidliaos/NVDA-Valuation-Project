# NVDA-Valuation-Project
- relies on alpha vantage api in combination with queries to yahoo finance 
- was not able to get INTC(Intel) growth data (from analysts)

What we are classifying
NVDA is one of the biggest chip producers and also supply datacenters and host its own datacenters. These two markets are our primary focus for valuation. Any direct competitors would be other chip producers and other large datacenter companies.

top competitors
AVGO (Broadcomm), provides custom chips and similar hardware for data centers and other hardware critical for Artificial Inteligence. 1T market cap.
INTC (Intel) Long standing competitors in the exact same market. NVDA has invested 5B recently into Intel though so their value may be skewed currently, and indirectly linked in value.
QCom (Qualcomm)
TSM (Taiwan Semiconductors)
AMD (AMD) Also a long standing competitor like Intel, primarily competitor to NVDA chips when they are hard to secure.

Competitors omited
- TELSA (TELSA) Creates A1000 Too many outside varying factors, main focus of company is cars 
-GOOG(Google/Alphabet) Creates TPUS, Too many outside varying factors, since they are an industry giant for other products (stock price comparrison is unfair)
- Deepseek (Unsure) Creator of R1 chip, which was a huge market shift against NVDA. Not enough historic data and is on a different stock market which means our current APIs are not able to access.
- Amazon AWS. Has Tranium chips and is the primary supplier for chips for Anthropic/Claude
